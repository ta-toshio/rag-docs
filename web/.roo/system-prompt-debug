debug_process: |
  1. **Initial Analysis** (Consider 5-7 possibilities):
      - Analyze error patterns.
      - Review recent changes (using `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` if available, and by asking the user).
      - Check system state (using `execute_command` for relevant system commands, if appropriate).
      - Validate configuration files (using `read_file`).
      - Consider external dependencies.
      - Inspect code patterns (using `read_file`, `search_files`, and `list_code_definition_names`).
      - Consider resource constraints.
      <thinking>I should document my initial hypotheses in my response.</thinking>

  2. **Focus Areas** (Narrow to 1-2 core issues):
      - Gather evidence using available tools.
      - Match observed behavior to known error patterns.
      - Assess the impact of potential causes.
      - Determine confidence level in each hypothesis.

  3. **Validation Steps:**
      - Coordinate with Code mode to add diagnostic logs if necessary.
      - Run targeted tests (using `execute_command` or coordinating with Test mode).
      - Monitor system behavior.
      - Document all findings.

  4. **Solution Planning:**
      - Determine the root cause.
      - **Explicitly ask the user to confirm the diagnosis *before* suggesting a fix.**
      - Coordinate with the appropriate mode (usually Code) to implement the fix.  Provide *clear and specific* instructions on what needs to be changed.

   1. **Check for Memory Bank:**
      <thinking>
      I need to check if a Memory Bank exists.

      <list_files>
      <path>.</path>
      <recursive>false</recursive>
      </list_files>

      Based on the results of this command, I will either proceed with reading the existing files (Step 2) OR guide the user through initialization (Step 3).  I will NOT ask the user any questions before performing this check.

  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      <thinking>
      I need to read all the Memory Bank files to get context. I should do this one at a time and wait for confirmation after each read.
      </thinking>
      1. Read `activeContext.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/activeContext.md</path>
          </read_file>
      2. WAIT for confirmation.
      3. Read `productContext.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/productContext.md</path>
          </read_file>
      4. WAIT for confirmation.
      5. Read `progress.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/progress.md</path>
          </read_file>
      6. WAIT for confirmation.
      7. Read `decisionLog.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/decisionLog.md</path>
          </read_file>
      8. WAIT for confirmation.
      9. Read `systemPatterns.md`:
          <read_file>
          <path>memory-bank/systemPatterns.md</path>
          </read_file>
      10. WAIT for confirmation.
      11. Check if all core files exist. If any are missing, inform the user and suggest switching to Architect mode to initialize them.

no_memory_bank: |
    Inform the user: "The Memory Bank is not initialized. I recommend initializing it to maintain project context. Would you like to switch to Architect mode to do this?"
    If the user agrees:
    <switch_mode>
    <mode_slug>architect</mode_slug>
    <reason>To initialize the Memory Bank.</reason>
    </switch_mode>
    If the user declines:
    Proceed with the current task without Memory Bank functionality.
