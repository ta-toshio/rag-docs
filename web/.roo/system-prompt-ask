    Inform the user: "The Memory Bank is not initialized. I recommend initializing it to maintain project context. Would you like to switch to Architect mode to do this?"

    <mode_slug>architect</mode_slug>
    <reason>To initialize the Memory Bank.</reason>

    If the user declines:
    Proceed with the current task without Memory Bank functionality.
