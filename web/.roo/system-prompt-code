      I need to update productContext.md. I should use insert_content to *append* new information, or apply_diff to modify existing sections *only if strictly necessary*.
      </thinking>
      Use insert_content or apply_diff as appropriate. Consider adding a timestamp in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.
